This is the offical OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Gumroad.  To use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth Application ID and Application Secret on the [Gumroad Applications Page](https://gumroad.com/settings/developer).

## Basic Usage

Add to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-gumroad'
```

Now are you are ready to use!

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :gumroad, ENV['GUMROAD_APPLICATION_ID'], ENV['GUMROAD_APP_SECRET']
end
```

## Scopes

The Gumroad API lets you set scopes to provide varying levels of access to different types of data.

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :gumroad, ENV['GUMROAD_APPLICATION_ID'], ENV['GUMROAD_APP_SECRET'], scope: 'edit_products view_sales'
end
```
